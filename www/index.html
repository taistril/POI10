              of all the points of interest to view en route. </p>

            <p>The name Otley is of Saxon origin from Othe, Otta or Otho, a Saxon 
              personal name, and leah, a woodland clearing in old English - hence 
              the Saxon cross relics in the Parish church, which you may see on 
              your walk.</p>
            <p>The town proper began in the 13th century with markets granted 
              Royal Charter in 1222 by Henry III. </p>
            <p>There were worsted mills during the Industrial revolution, but 
              by 1900 over 2000 people were employed locally in the printing machinery 
              trade, following the invention of the Wharfedale Printing Machine 
              in Otley.</p>
            <p>A large paper mill next to the river was also a big employer for 
              150 years but now sadly has been demolished.</p>
            <p>Probably the best-known person to come from Otley is Thomas Chippendale 
              the 18th century cabinetmaker.</p>

              hence the letters NA above the datestone on the west end. The bricked 
              up doorway under the datestone was once reached by an outside staircase. 
              The upper storey was used as the town's assembly rooms and later 
              as a place of worship. The Bowling Green Inn took over the whole 
              of the building in 1825. The premises were refurbished by J D Wetherspoon 
              in June 2010'.</p>
